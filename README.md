# ZX

A Zig library for building full-stack web applications with JSX-like syntax. Write declarative UI components using familiar JSX patterns, transpiled to efficient Zig code.

ZX combines the power and performance of Zig with the expressiveness of JSX, enabling you to build fast, type-safe web applications. ZX is significantly faster than frameworks like Next.js at SSR.

## Quick Example

```tsx site/pages/examples/overview.zx
pub fn QuickExample(allocator: zx.Allocator) zx.Component {
    const is_loading = true;
    const chars = "Hello, ZX Dev!";
    var i: usize = 0;
    return (
        <main @allocator={allocator}>
            <section>
                {if (is_loading) (<h1>Loading...</h1>) else (<h1>Loaded</h1>)}
            </section>
        
            <section>
                {for (chars) |char| (<span>{char}</span>)}
            </section>
        
            <section>
                {for (users) |user| (
                    <Profile name={user.name} age={user.age} role={user.role} />
                )}
            </section>

            <section>
                {while (i < 10) : (i += 1) (<p>{i}</p>)}
            </section>
        </main>
    );
}

fn Profile(allocator: zx.Allocator, user: User) zx.Component {
    return (
        <div @allocator={allocator}>
            <h1>{user.name}</h1>
            <p>{user.age}</p>
            {switch (user.role) {
                .admin => (<p>Admin</p>),
                .member => (<p>Member</p>),
            }}
        </div>
    );
}

const UserRole = enum { admin, member };
const User = struct { name: []const u8, age: u32, role: UserRole };

const users = [_]User{
    .{ .name = "John", .age = 20, .role = .admin },
    .{ .name = "Jane", .age = 21, .role = .member },
};

const zx = @import("zx");
